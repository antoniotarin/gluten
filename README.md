# Description:

Gluten is an OpenGL application that creates a 3D hierarchy chart from a structured text file.
The app opens and interprets a custom text file using a defined syntax for establishing parent & child concepts.
After parsing, cubes and interconnecting lines are iteratively generated, building a visual information map.

We made this software on C++ using GLUT, a toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.
